# Taking pictures from JavaScript

This example uses the FuseJS Camera, ImageTools and CameraRoll APIs to acquire and manipulate images from JavaScript.

Basic Camera use is simple:
```
var Camera = require('FuseJS/Camera');
Camera.takePicture(/* target width */ 1080, /* target height */ 1920}).then(function(newImage){
    image.value = newImage.path;
});
```
`takePicture` returns a `Promise` that will resolve to an object of image info once the picture has been taken.
We can then get the `path` property of that object and use it to display the image.

* Note: The target width and target height in this scenario are used to determine bounds for an aspect-corrected resize.
The dimensions of the returned image can differ if the original aspect is different.

The sample js is extensively commented and goes through some somewhat arbitrary use cases.
